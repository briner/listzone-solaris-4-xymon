from email in xymon: xymon storage for ext scripts
You can enable the hobbitd_filestore module to save the
data to disk automatically, but I recommend against it 
because it increases the load on your Xymon server 
significantly (much more disk I/O).

You can also setup a module on the Xymon server to process
this data, which reads the data from a "hobbitd_channel"
process. That is the only way to capture stuff sent with
a "data" message. If you send it in a "status" message it
will show up on the webpage, and you can also use the
"bb" command to fetch the data from the Xymon server.
E.g. to get the data from the "mytest" status on server
"myserver":

  bb 127.0.0.1 "hobbitdlog myserver.mytest"
